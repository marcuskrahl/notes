## Defining Terms

- Term is defined elsewhere?
  - Link to description
- Single term
  - describe it
- Multiple terms
  - create a glossary

## Words
- Use terms consistently (App Registration vs. Application Registration)
  - but can be introduced as a variant (e.g. Application Registrations (or App Registrations for short))
- Introduce acronyms along a (highlighted) expanded term
  - Then only use acronym or only use expanded term. do not mix
  - prefer acronym only if it is a lot shorter than the term and is used a lot in the document or if it has an "identity" of its own, e.g. HTML
- Pronouns may be used for stylistic reasons
  - But avoid Pronouns if there are more than 5 words between a noun and its pronoun
  - Also avoid Pronouns if there is another noun between a noun and its pronoun, e.g. A document applies a styling for its words
  - Avoid it, they, them and their because these words are confusing
  - Also avoid this and that or use them together with a noun. This example demonstrates this hint


## Tipps
- Use active voice instead of passive voice
  - active voice is shorter
  - active voice is less complicated
  - active voice always has an actor while passive voice may omit the actor
- Use strong verbs
  - avoid weak verbs like is, am, were, ..., occur, happen
  - weak verbs may indicate other problems like passive voice or a missing actor
  - especially avoid "There is" and "There are"
    - There are two problems with this solution vs. You should consider two problems with this solution
- Use short sentences
  - A single sentence should cover a single idea
  - Break down long sentences into lists
    - the conjunction "or" may be a trigger for this
  - replace filler words like "is able to" -> "can"
  - avoid subordinate clauses
    - look for "which" , "that",...
    - only keep subordinate clauses if they extend the idea of the main clause
- transform "inline" lists in a single sentence into proper lists
- list items should be uniformly
  - same grammar structure
  - same logical level
  - same punctuation
  - same capitalization
- Introduce lists and tables
  - "The following list defines available user permissions: "
- first sentence of a paragraph should introduce the theme directly 
- one idea per paragraph 
  - move sentences of other ideas into another paragraph
- ideal paragraph length is 3 to 5 sentences
- Each paragraph should emphasize:
  - What is the central idea?
  - Why is it important for the reader to know this?
  - How can the reader apply this idea?
- An introductory sentence may convey what the reader is expected to learn
  - Mention what is missing in this document
  - Define prerequisite knowledge
