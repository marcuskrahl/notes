# Ubiquitous Language


Ubiquitous Language is one of the core principles of the domain driven design. It is a language shared between business experts, architects and developers.

This language is "spoken" in the archictecture, diagrams, program code especially names and most importantly in meetings when talking to each other.
It is a shared understanding of the problem domain for each stakeholder.

The language may evolve and adept over time. This includes filtering the language to aspects which are really important in the system part of the problem domain. In other words it is a subset of the language business experts are using in their daily work.
