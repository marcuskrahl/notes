# Basics

The architecture of a software system is composed of its components, the relationships between the components and cross cutting concerns.

Architecture is guided by long term goals, especially to fulfill quality measures (maintainability, security, extensability, ...)

Quality measures especially come from stake holders (key users, ops, government, ...)
