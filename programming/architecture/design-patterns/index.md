# Design Patterns

## Definition

A design pattern is a proven and battle tested solution for particular problems arising in the design of software. 
They should be used whenever a simple design for a concrete problem does not fully solve the problem. 
They sometimes have to be modified to fit into the problem domain.

## Pattern Catalogs

Pattern Catalogs collect proven patterns for a given domain or general usage. 

They usually provide:
- a definition
- a class diagram
- an example 
- when to use the pattern
- when not to use the pattern
- things to keep in mind when using a pattern

Pattern catalogs:
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) Huge collection of patterns, but written "in wikipedia style"
- [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) Easier understanding of patterns but limited to Group of Four patterns

## Anti Patterns

A kind of pattern which might seem to be appropriate to solve a given problem, but is in fact not solving it or results in a lot of overhead.
By collecting these "traps" other programmers ran into they can be avoided in the future.
