# Design


## Design Ways

### Material

### Neumorphism

UI elements seem to be part of the background and are "intruded" or "extruded" from it.

See: https://css-tricks.com/neumorphism-and-css/

Neumorphism may provide bad accessibilty and usability because elements are hard to distingush from background
