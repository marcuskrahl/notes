## Icons do not enhance Usability

Source: https://uxmyths.com/post/715009009/myth-icons-enhance-usability

- Icons do not provide little value
- Buttons are more commonly remembered by position than icon
- A label is better suited in almost all cases

But:

- Common icons (play, pause, ...) may be helpful
- May increase visual appeal
